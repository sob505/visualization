Project 1: Visualization
Sachi Barnaby

This project creates a GUI to visualize times tables using a circle and lines.
To run it, just run Visualization.main(). You can use each of the sliders to control different parts of the
visualization (as indicated in text), and you can use the button to stop or start the animation. The animation 
automatically cycles through 72 different colors by changing the hue value in HSB (see findColors()).

See comments before each method for more information.
