Project 1: Visualization
Sachi Barnaby

This project creates a GUI to visualize modulo times tables using a circle and lines.
To run it, just run Visualization.main(). You can use each of the sliders to control different parts of the
visualization (as indicated in text), and you can use the button to stop or start the animation. The animation 
automatically cycles through 72 different colors by changing the hue value in HSB (see findColors()).

When the first and second sliders and moved, the animation will not pause. However, with the third and fourth sliders, the animation will pause. Press the Play button to restart the animation from the circle now shown.

Requirements:
• Handle times tables of numbers up to 360 - See fourth slider
• Handle up to 360 points around the circle - See third slider
• Button to pause and start the visualization at will - See Pause button
• Control to change the increment size of each time step - See first slider
• Control to change how fast the visualization runs (frames per second) - See second slider
• Control to jump to any given times table number and number of points - See fourth and third slider, respectively
• Ability to cycle between at least 10 different colors as visualization runs - See circle

See comments before each method for more information.
